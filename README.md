# Periodic Table Database
My Periodic Table Database solution for freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification.

Using Bash, PostgreSQL and GIT.

The Shell script is intended for use in a Bash terminal and it works alongside a database for periodic elements. When the user inputs a number (like 1), a letter (like 'H') or a word (like 'Hydrogen') the script will search the DB and provide the following template of information if a match is found (otherwise it will ask for an argument if one is not given or for an appropiate one if one is given that's not in the DB):

~~~~~

The element with atomic number 1 is Hydrogen (H). It's a nonmetal, with a mass of 1.008 amu. Hydrogen has a melting point of -259.1 celsius and a boiling point of -252.9 celsius.
